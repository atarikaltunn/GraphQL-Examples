# GraphQL Notes

This is my GraphQL with NodeJS Learning repository that aims to leave some notes to me and to society. All examples are taken from [document of GraphQL JavaScript](https://graphql.org/graphql-js)

## What is GraphQL
A query language for your API:
    It helps to servers by managing which part of a data is needed so that server just takes that part and so GraphQL helps to decrease traffic and speed. At the same time GraphQL helps to clients to take just needed data and not to take any unnecessary data thus clients are able to cope with API's responses more easily.


## Learning With Examples
1. Prerequisities:

In this tutorial, we are going to use NodeJS v16.17.0 with npm v8.15.0. Every part of examples would need different packages installed. Create a folder and initilize NodeJS by running 
    `npm init -y`
With -y flag, we are creating a project with no-info.

2. Examples:
    
    - Hello World:

    In this tutorial, we are getting started with GraphQL with NodeJS and we will learn fundamental template of GraphQL. We need to install graphql package by running:
    ` npm install graphql `


    - GraphiQL:

    In this tutorial we gonna meet with GraphQL API called GraphiQL in server we run with express. Needed packages are:
    `npm install express graphql express-graphql`
    There would be a little error occur, go and search in google. It is easy error to solve :)


    - Basic Types:

    In this tutorial, we are going to learn create a schema with different data types like int, string, float, array. There is no different package from previous example.
